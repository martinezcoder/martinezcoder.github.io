## **Hi!**

My name is **Fran Martinez**. Nice to meet you! I a backend developer borned in Barcelona city, although since some years ago I live in an small village in the mountains of AlmerÃ­a, Spain. I started my career in 2005 but it was not until I discovered Ruby that I became a proud developer.

I like all about development culture, from the product definition to development, but I what I most like is to share knowledge and open my mind to other points of view. Every product is the result of a shared artistic process; it's the result of collaborative work, and that's why I like responsible and enthusiastic people, who shares knowledge and who spend their time helping others to improve. This is at least what I try to do.

I have been always looking to work remotely and it was on 2016 when I achieved this dream. Working remotely changed my life and now I am currently a proud evangelist of this working culture.

## **What can I do**

### > Ruby

**10 years** experience with Ruby. From the creation of a Rails app to a **PORO** ruby coder. The Ruby community made me be reborn as a developer in 2012. Since then, I have learn the SOLID principles, design patterns, metaprogramming, git, TDD and Agile.

I am more focused in the **backend side**, but I am not afraid of doing some piece of Javascript.

### > Design patterns, architecture

I like design patterns and architecture, take part on conversations about refactors, improvements and make scalable solutions.

### > Javascript and frontend

Despite my professional career has always been focused in the backend side, I like the full stack. I am not afraid of using Javascript, CSS and HTML. And I like to play with frameworks like **Vue** or **React**. But I recognise that I am a junior on these frameworks area.

### > Docker and Kubernetes

I always use Docker. Is not as fast as using native installations, but the versatility to have a service up and running without having to take care about installations is the best magic ever!

### > Srum/Agile and Kanban workflows

I have worked with **Scrum** and **Kanban**. I have been **scrum master and team lead** for a team of 7.

On the discussion between **Scrum** and **Kanban** I reckon that I am in love with Kanban methodology when it has to be applied to asynchronous remote teams. However, I have years of experience working with Scrum and applying team workflows in companies.


## **More about me**

I am a very friendly person who likes to learn every day as a way of life. That's why I like remote jobs, in order to have this balance between professional and personal skills.

I am a peaceful guy who likes to meet friends, practice a lot of yoga, play the guitar, use renewable energies, and read about programming, philosophy, science fiction and classical novels. I also have a garden where I sow everything I can to harvest it and eat my own fruits and vegatables. I like cooking my vegetables!
