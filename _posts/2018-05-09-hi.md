## **Hi!**

My name is **Fran Martinez**. Nice to meet you! I a Web developer from Barcelona, Spain. I started my career in 2005 but it was not until I discovered Ruby that I became a proud developer.

I like all about development culture, from the product definition to development, but I what I most like is to share knowledge and open my mind to other points of view. Every product is the result of a shared artistic process; it's the result of collaborative work, and that's why I like responsible and enthusiastic people, who shares knowledge and who spend his time helping others to improve. This is at least what I try to do.

I have been always looking to work remotely and it was on 2016 when I achieved this dream. Working remotely changed my life and now I am currently a proud evangelist of this working culture.

## **What can I do**

### > Ruby

**7 years** experience with Ruby. From the **full stack** creation of a Rails app to a **PORO** ruby coder. The Ruby community made me be reborn as a developer in 2012. Since then, I have learn the SOLID principles, design patterns, metaprogramming, git, TDD and Agile/Kanban.

I am more focused in the **backend side**, but I am not afraid of doing Javascript or CSS.

### > Design patterns, architecture

I like to spend some hours a week to improve my design patterns knowledge. Learning patterns is easy, but to know when to apply them is another more complex story.

### > Amazon Web Services

I have been working with <b>SQS</b>, <b>SNS</b>, <b>EC2</b>, <b>S3</b>, <b>Lambda</b>.

### > Relational databases

**Mysql**, **PostgeSQL**, **SQLite**, **Oracle**. **14 years** experience with relational databases. I can do any kind of query! Further, I worked during 3 years with Pro\*C, the C precompiler for Oracle, a really good way to work in a C real-time application that consumes the data from an Oracle Datawarehouse.


### > Javascript and frontend

Despite my professional career has always been focused in the backend side, I like the full stack. I am not afraid of using Javascript, CSS and HTML. And I like to play with frameworks like **Vue** or **React**.

### > Docker

I always use it. Give me a computer and I will only install Docker to start programming anything. That's the best magic ever!

### > Other languages like PHP and C/C++

Many years ago, I worked for 3 years as a backend developer with C and C++ in a client-server application for the main energy company in Spain.

I have review some PHP code. I know how it works in a web environment and I have maintain some old php code.

### > Srum/Agile and Kanban workflows

I have worked with **Scrum** and **Kanban**. I have been **scrum master and team lead** for a team of 7.

In the war of **Scrum** vs **Kanban** I reckon that I am in love with Kanban methodology when it has to be applied to asynchronous remote teams.


## **More about me**

I am a very friendly person who likes to learn every day as a way of life. That's why I like remote jobs, in order to have this balance between professional and personal skills.

I am a peaceful guy who likes to meet friends, practice a lot of yoga, play the guitar, use renewable energies, and read about programming, philosophy, science fiction and classical novels.
