## **Hi!**

My name is **Fran Martinez**. Nice to meet you! I a Web developer from Barcelona, Spain. I started my career in 2005 but it was not until I discovered Ruby that I became a proud developer.

I like all about development culture, from the product definition to development, but I what I most like is to share knowledge and open my mind to other points of view. Every product is the result of a shared artistic process; it's the result of collaborative work, and that's why I like responsible and enthusiastic people, who shares knowledge and who spend his time helping others to improve. This is at least what I try to do.

## **What can I do**

### > Ruby on Rails

**5 years** experience with Ruby. From the **full stack** creation of an app to a **PORO** ruby coder. The Ruby community made me be reborn as a developer in 2012. Since then, I have learn the SOLID principles, design patterns, metaprogramming, git, TDD and Agile/Kanban.

I am more focused in the **backend side**, but I am not afraid of doing Javascript or CSS.


### > Amazon Web Services

I have been working with <b>SQS</b>, <b>SNS</b>, <b>EC2</b>, <b>S3</b>, <b>Lambda</b>. 

### > Relational databases

**Mysql**, **PostgeSQL**, **SQLite**, **Oracle**. **14 years** experience with relational databases. I can do any kind of query! Further, I worked during 3 years with Pro\*C, the C precompiler for Oracle, a really good way to work in a C real-time application that consumes the data from an Oracle Datawarehouse.


### > Javascript and frameworks

I am very sad to say that I am not an expert here. I know the basis of pure **Javascript**, I know what the **DOM**, the **BOM** and **ECMAScript 6** is, I know how to use OOP with Javascript and I have tried **React** and **Vue**.  But in a commercial environment, I have just used it to add some AJAX responses. I would be the most happiest man in the world if I can do a bit more about this in my next challenge! 


### > Docker

I started using Docker some years ago. Since then, I always use it. Give me a computer and I will only install Docker to start programming anything. That's the best magic ever!


### > C/C++

3 years experience working as a backend developer with C and C++ in a client-server application for the main energy company in Spain.



### > Srum/Agile and Kanban workflows

I have worked with **Scrum** and **Kanban**. Using **Jira**, **Pivotal tracker** and **Trello**. I have been scrum master for a team of 7 where I was the team lead.


## **More about me**

I am a very friendly person who likes to learn every day as a way of life. That's why I like semi-remote jobs, in order to have this balance between professional and personal skills. I am a peaceful guy who likes to meet friends, practice a lot of yoga, play the guitar, use renewable energies, and read about programming, philosophy, science and classical novels.
